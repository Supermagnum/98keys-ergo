A 98 key ergonomic,split keyboard.
Its powered by a Raspberry pico.

I have attempted to make a keymap, any help correcting this and other errors is extremely appreticated!

The keys without any letters/numbers:

Attempt at creating a layout with keys/numbers in Norwegian QWERTY:

The L1/L2 button is to change from  Norwegian QWERTY to Norwegian Dvorak.


PWM1 to PWM 4 controls LED's based by the active layer, and also caps lock and scroll lock active.
Those can be found here:

The right side has identical outputs for PWM.

Cherry MX switches should fit the PCB'S.
